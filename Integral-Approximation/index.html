  <title>Integral Approximation</title>

  <h1>Integral Approximation</h1>
  <h3>
    This approximates the area under the given function through two seperate techniques that are <br>
    currently included. One of which is the Riemann Sum which approximates the area by the summation <br>
    of rectangles and the other is trapezoidal rule which similarly, approximates via the summation <br>
    of trapezoids under the curve.

    <b>Quick Summary</b>
    <br>
    Riemann Sum is basically creating rectangles under the function and summing the area to <br>
    approximate the total area under the curve within the given domain. This method however <br>
    consists of many variation. I.e. to reduce error bounds, it is possible to calculate <br>
    a Riemann Sum of a function from left to right and vice versa. It can also be calculated <br>
    by taking the area from the midpoints of every partition. Nonetheless, these errors <br>
    could be minimized by increasing the quantity of partitions (which are the amounts <br>
    of rectangles under the curve) and easily approximate the area under the curve. <br>

  <h4>There will not be an option to select your own function and compute for that as that would require parsing <br>of math and debugging which I am not very familiar with javascript. Since this is intended as a demonstration,<br> this program will suffice the intention</h4>
