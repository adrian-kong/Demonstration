# Demonstration
Demonstration for my Math Club in Javascript. This will demonstrate the functions and their uses for my maths club. 

I.e. (to be added)
- Newtons Difference quotient for differentiation approximation
- Riemann Sum for integral approximation
- Trapezoidal Sum for integral approximation
- Newton Raphson root approximation
- Graphs of functions.
- Multivariable integration and differentiation

etc
